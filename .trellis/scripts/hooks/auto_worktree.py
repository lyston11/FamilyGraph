"""Trellis ``after_start`` hook: isolate every started task in its own worktree.

Reads ``TASK_JSON_PATH`` (exported by ``run_task_hooks``), ensures branch
``feat/<task-dir-name>`` is checked out in a linked worktree at
``../fg-<task-dir-name>``, and records both in task.json (``branch`` /
``worktree_path``). The checkout that ran ``task.py start`` is never touched.

Exit 0 on success and benign skips; exit 1 on real failures so
``run_task_hooks`` surfaces the captured output as its warning (hook output is
swallowed on success — task.json is the machine-readable record, the AGENTS.md
"并行任务与 Git 隔离" section is the human-readable contract).
